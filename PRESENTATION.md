# What are we going to learn? Why is it cool?

Technology impacts our brain and behavior

<aside class="notes">
Every top level markdown header in this file will be translated into a "section" in your HTML5 output. This output will be plain, using only the base reveal.js style. The command above, mutatis mutandis, will let you do the conversion.

To add audio, you have to add the data-audio-src attribute and specify a path to the associated audio file in your HTML file, as shown on the screen. Using this technique, you should only add the audio after you have written your presentation in the form of the file that we converted to make this presentation. That input file uses markdown with embedded "aside" tags with notes as the class.

Reveal is very powerful, so try exploring some of its features, but be careful not to make any changes that you can't roll back. In other words, make a change, use git to add, commit, and push. Then test. If you don't like the change, you can always roll it back. If you do this, then you will be able to fix things easily if you break something by reverting your last commit. If you are testing locally, you don't have to push your changes. Just commit them. You will still be able to roll them back using the git revert command.

# Designed to distract

<aside class="notes">

Intermittent variable rewards keep coming back. For example, pulling down in the apple email 
app to refresh, checking to see if your post got likes, or scrolling down on any social media
site looking for that next great distraction.

# Instant Interruptions

<aside class="notes">
It takes the average person 23 minutes to resume focus after an interruption. And 
a bunch of external interruptions in one hour leads to more self-interruptions in the next
hour.

# A Bottomless Bowl

<aside class="notes">
Bottomless bowls, infinite scroll feeds, and automatic play keep people consuming even
when they are no longer hungry. Netflix automatically plays the next episode. Your twitter feed
never runs out.

# Empower the user

<aside class="notes">
Users tend to blame themselves for lack of self-control and being easily distracted by media.
But humans have never before experienced this level of intentional distraction.

# What if technology was on our team?

<aside class="notes">
What if technology was on our team? What if it aligned with our values and helped us live
the way we want to? Tech design could replace impulse with conscious choices and put the 
user back in control.
