In today's modern society, the technological advances are never-ending. We have advanced from a strictly pen and paper universe to dial-up internet and stationary desktop computers to having a small internet connected device in our pockets. In a world of constantly changing technology, the possibilities are endless.

<p>With all of the technological advances that have made its way into our society, we are evolving to match the new abilities technology has given us. In an age where the internet is easily accessible, we are now able to quickly find information by doing a simple google search and it is also possible to easily communicate with people who might be hundreds or thousands of miles away. Moreover, technology has advanced to the point where the functions of multiple devices can now be compacted into one single device. For example, as opposed to having to use a separate phone, camera, and gps, there are now smartphones that are capable of being all of these devices at once.</p>

When it comes to technology, like anything else in this world that can have many different effects on people, ethics is usually a necessary subject to discuss. There are many questions that can be asked when it comes to the advancement and design of technology. Is there a definition of what should and shouldn't be allowed when designing technology? Is there an ethical boundary that shouldn't be crossed? How does the design of technology affect its users? In this presentation we will be discussing ways technology can affect the brain and human behavior as well as discussing design ethics and its examples, issues, and possible solutions.

<aside class="notes">
When the word menu is mentioned, a person's first thought would probably be a list of food options when ordering at a restaurant, but in reality, menus show up in our lives even when we don't realize it. Because of technology, a lot of decisions we make in our everyday lives have been converted into menus. Deciding who we want to invite to hang out becomes a menu of the most recent people we've texted. The question of what is currently happening locally and globally becomes a menu of social media posts. Although this generally does make the process of decision making easier, it also has shaped us into a habit of no longer asking questions. No one asks what's not on the menu or what other options there could other than the ones right in front of us. No one questions why the choices on the menu were the ones given to us, we just tend to accept them as they are. No one asks if the choices provided are satisfying the user’s original goal or if they actually a distraction.

<aside class="notes">
In a world where most people in technologically advanced societies have smartphones and laptops and social media accounts, we have developed a desire to always be connected. We end up constantly paying continuous partial attention and many of us end up with an &quot;always-on, anywhere, anytime, anyplace&quot; mindset. No matter where we are or what time it is, we want to be aware of what is happening online. This mindset causes us to be constantly on high alert to ensure that we don't miss anything.

<aside class="notes">
<p>The advancement of technology and the rise of popularity of search engines, like google, has affected human memory. Research has shown that people don’t remember as many things because they don’t feel it is necessary since they can easily access it via google. In an experiment conducted by Betsy Sparrow, students were given trivia facts to type on a computer. Half of the group were told that the computer would not save anything they typed and the other half were told that the computer would save everything and that they would have access to it later. Afterwards, the students were asked to write down the facts from memory. Those who were told that the computer would erase what they wrote were able to recall more facts that those who were told that the computer would save their writing. This experiment showed that people naturally do not remember as much information when they know for sure that they will have access to it in the future. Why remember something when you can easily pull out your phone and conduct a google search?</p>

Messages and notifications that interrupt people immediately are more effective at grabbing someone's attention. Coupled with read receipts that increase social pressure, instant interruptions result in billions of unnecessary interruptions every day.

<h1>Psychological weaknesses are not the problem</h1>
<aside class="notes">
Users tend to blame themselves for lack of self-control, but humans have never before experienced this level of intentional distraction. Researchers have found that it takes the average person 23 minutes to resume focus after an interruption. And a bunch of external interruptions in one hour leads to more self-interruptions in the next hour.

What if technology was on our team? What if it aligned with our values and helped us live the way we want to? Tech design could replace impulse with conscious choices and put the user back in control.

<h1>Respectful Delivery, not Intant Interruption</h1>
<aside class="notes">
For example, consider messaging applications like iMessage or Google Chat. What if the user could temporarily turn off notifications in a 'productivity mode'? The system could tell anyone trying to contact that person they are in productivity mode and provide an option for the other user to interrupt if the communication is urgent. This could eliminate unncessary distractions while allowing users to relax and focus knowing they are not missing anything urgent.
