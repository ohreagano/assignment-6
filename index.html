In today's modern society, the technological advances are never-ending. We have advanced from a strictly pen and paper univers to dial-up internet and stationary desktop computers to having a small internet connected device in our pockets. In this world of constantly changing technology, the possibilities are endless.

<p>With all of the technological advances that have made its way into our society, we are evolving to match the new abilities technology has given us. In an age where the internet is easily accessible, we are now able to quickly research and find information by doing a simple google search. The internet has also made it easier to connect with people and has made it possible</p>

To add audio, you have to add the data-audio-src attribute and specify a path to the associated audio file in your HTML file, as shown on the screen. Using this technique, you should only add the audio after you have written your presentation in the form of the file that we converted to make this presentation. That input file uses markdown with embedded &quot;aside&quot; tags with notes as the class.

<p>Reveal is very powerful, so try exploring some of its features, but be careful not to make any changes that you can't roll back. In other words, make a change, use git to add, commit, and push. Then test. If you don't like the change, you can always roll it back. If you do this, then you will be able to fix things easily if you break something by reverting your last commit. If you are testing locally, you don't have to push your changes. Just commit them. You will still be able to roll them back using the git revert command. &lt;&gt;</p>

Messages and notifications that interrupt people immediately are more effective at grabbing someone's attention. Coupled with read receipts that increase social pressure, instant interruptions result in billions of unnecessary interruptions every day.

Intermittent variable rewards keep users coming back. For example, pulling down in the apple email app to refresh, checking to see if your post got likes, or scrolling down on any social media site looking for that next great distraction.

Bottomless bowls, infinite scroll feeds, and automatic play keep people consuming even when they are no longer hungry. Netflix automatically plays the next episode. Your twitter feed never runs out.

<h1>Psychological weaknesses are not the problem</h1>
<aside class="notes">
Users tend to blame themselves for lack of self-control, but humans have never before experienced this level of intentional distraction. Researchers have found that it takes the average person 23 minutes to resume focus after an interruption. And a bunch of external interruptions in one hour leads to more self-interruptions in the next hour.

<h1>What if technology was on our team?</h1>
<aside class="notes">
What if technology was on our team? What if it aligned with our values and helped us live the way we want to? Tech design could replace impulse with conscious choices and put the user back in control.

<section id="respectful-delivery-not-intant-interruption" class="slide level1">
<h1>Respectful Delivery, not Intant Interruption</h1>
<aside class="notes">
For example, consider messaging applications like iMessage or Google Chat. What if the user could temporarily turn off notifications in a 'productivity mode'? The system could tell anyone trying to contact that person they are in productivity mode and provide an option for the other user to interrupt if the communication is urgent. This could eliminate unncessary distractions while allowing users to relax and focus knowing they are not missing anything urgent.
